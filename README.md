> ### HOWTO work with git on this project
> - Give branches specific names reflecting their assigned functionality, avoiding generic terms. (ex.: use `implement-catalog-cards` instead of `frontend` or `create-user-permissions` instead of `update backend`).
> - Write clear commit descriptions that explain the changes made, avoiding using unclear language.
> - Before merging a branch into the main one, use `rebase` to include all changes made to the main branch after your branch was created.
> - Request team approval before merging and only when the functionality is fully prepared for review, not during ongoing work
> - If a PR is rejected or needs fixes, discuss with the team to identify issues, and then add new commits with the necessary corrections.
