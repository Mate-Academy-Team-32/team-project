## Front-End and Back-end parts of website

### Front-End part

Before you start your [local server](http://localhost:3000/) at 3000 port, you have to:

1 - Download NPM (Node Packet Manager) at least v14 or newer;
2 - Clone that project on your computer: git clone https://github.com/Mate-Academy-Team-32/team-project.git;
3 - Run command to install required dependencies: npm i;
4 - Run command to start local server: npm start;
5 - The project will be opened after last command.

Yes, you did it. Congratulation!

### Back-End part


### HOWTO work with git on this project
> - Give branches specific names reflecting their assigned functionality, avoiding generic terms. (ex.: use `implement-catalog-cards` instead of `frontend` or `create-user-permissions` instead of `update backend`).
> - Write clear commit descriptions that explain the changes made, avoiding using unclear language.
> - Before merging a branch into the main one, use `rebase` to include all changes made to the main branch after your branch was created.
> - Request team approval before merging and only when the functionality is fully prepared for review, not during ongoing work
> - If a PR is rejected or needs fixes, discuss with the team to identify issues, and then add new commits with the necessary corrections.
